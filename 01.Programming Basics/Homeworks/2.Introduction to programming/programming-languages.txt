1. Java
Java is top pick as one of the most popular programming languages, used for 
building server-side applications to video games and mobile apps. It's also 
the core foundation for developing Android apps, making it a favorite of many 
programmers. Java is the most similar language to C#. The Object-oriented 
programming in C# is almost the same as the OOP in Java. One difference 
between the two programming languages is that in C# classes and methods are
written in PascalCase and in Java in camelCase.

2. C++

and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level 
memory manipulation. C# is pretty similar to C++.

3.PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but also 
used as a general-purpose programming language. C# is object-orriented programming 
language and PHP is not.

4.JavaScript
JavaScript is a high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted 
programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential 
technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites 
employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. 
JavaScript is a lot different compared to C#.

5.Python - Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming 
language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and 
its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than 
would be possible in languages such as C++, or Java. The language 
provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large 
scale. Python is not similar to C#.
